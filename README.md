# base_ml_development

This repository is a template which allows the creation of docker images which can be used to execute ML code with Keras and Tensorflow in JupyterLabs.
The docker image also supports the use of GPU for parallel ML processing. 

If you are looking for the image generated by this code, feel free to use the your prefered image from [this hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/1150524/keras_jupyterlabs/general).

You can use the following docker-compose:
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  jupyter:
    build: 1150524/keras_jupyerlabs:latest
    volumes:
     - ${LOCAL_WORKING_DIR}:/data/jupyter
     - ${LOCAL_DATASETS}:/data/jupyter/datasets
     - ${LOCAL_MODULES}:/git/python_modules
     - ${LOCAL_SSL_CERTS}:/opt/ssl-certs/jupyter
    ports:
     - "${PORT}:8888"
    container_name: keras_jupyter
    command: "start-notebook.sh \
        --NotebookApp.password=${ACCESS_TOKEN} \
        --NotebookApp.certfile=/etc/ssl/notebook/jupyter.pem"

```

Do not forget to run the following command:
```bash
openssl req -x509 -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout jupyter.pem -out jupyter.pem
```
in order to create a SSL certificate, and to replace the preexisting jupyter.pem
